The Grassland Restoration Action, Science and Stewardship Network (GRASS-Net) -- GRASS-Net envisions successful grassland restoration projects that take best practices into consideration, that are cost effective, prepared for the erratic drought regimes of the climate crisis, and promote regionally diverse and culturally significant species. We aim to bring together restoration practitioners across the state to share knowledge and minimize biotic homogenization in restored areas. Biologically diverse California (CA) range and grasslands are an increasingly crucial solution to carbon capture and climate change mitigation opportunities. Californiaâ€™s grasslands are biodiversity hotspots and globally unique, but climate change will make it unsuitable for endemic species; so innovative restoration must focus on climate resilience for a diverse suite of species. Recent research found that restoration of California grasslands typically focuses on only 7 key perennial species across the entire coast.

GRASS-Net encourages increased communication between land managers, non-government organizations, state/Federal agencies, private firms, and tribes. Participants in GRASS-Net benefit by having a space to troubleshoot mistakes, exchanging techniques, and sharing information about seed and invasive species management, to name a few. We are still developing what this network could look like and how it may function. We are now piloting a new [California Grasslands Sub-Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cagrasslands/) led by our Technical Advisory Committee Member, Dr. Julia Michaels, and GRASS-Net Coordinator, Tonia Brito-Bersi.
